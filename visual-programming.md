# Visual programming

Visual programming is a necessity. Some tasks should be better displayed in function blocks, some assignments should be displayed in mathematical equations, sometimes inputs and outputs should be declared in tables. Sometimes we need to add photo/drawing inside the code, like a circuit schematic.

# Proposal 

A file explorer application can be deployed where we could create arrows and change shapes/colors of a file icon. This graphical information can be kept in a separate file named `.visual`, possibly in JSON format. This information can be used to generate additional code for the compiler. 

Mathematical equations should be represented in OpenOffice Math syntax.
