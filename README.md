# creat-ide (DRAFT)

Every project needs a different type of IDE. If you create a electronic circuit board, that will need a serial port terminal, you will open a code editor, a remote debugger window, a serial port terminal, electronic design automation software, etc... There is no IDE that puts all these together. 

On the other hand, If you need a web application development, you will put your favourite web browser on one side, it's debugger window and your code editor on the other side. You will possibly need another layout for updating your server, possibly with SSH connection.

So we need actually an application that will hold these windows side by side and create some workspaces:

These panes will be controlled like how Blender does.
